My dotfiles are inspired by @holman's and like his are organized into topics
(bash, git, tmux, etc). Make sure to check is blog post [Dotfiles Are Meant to
Be Forked][holman-post] and his [dotfiles][holman-dotfiles].

## Install

Make sure to backup your config files, because this will nuke 'em.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aliou/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh install.sh
```

My Vim configuration has its [own repo][vim].
